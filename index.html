          Stibbe’s research examines how language encodes the stories we
          live by, and shapes how we see ourselves and our relationship with
          other animals and the earth. This involves linguistic analysis of a
          wide range of discourses, from advertising which encourages people to
          buy unnecessary and ecologically damaging products, to the
          inspirational language of nature writing. He is the founder of the

        <strong>Sentientism </strong></br>
        <em>Evidence, reason and compassion for all sentient beings</em><br />Hosted by Jaime Woodhouse, the Sentientism
        podcast discusses the biggest
        questions: "what's real?", "who matters?" and "how to make a better
        world?" with scientists, celebrities, activists, writers and
        philosophers. The Sentientism worldview is a simple, yet radical,
        philosophy that's grounded in reality (naturalistic epistemology) and
        has compassion for all sentient beings (mostly human and non-human
        animals). Naturalism & sentiocentrism combined.</br>
