        “The stories we live by are
        <span class="highlight-bright">encoded in language.</span> These stories shape our <span
          class="highlight-bright">relationship with the
          natural world,</span> determining whether we exploit it or
        <span class="highlight-bright">care</span> for it.”
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>In this episode of the <i>Sentientism</i> podcast, Dr. Arron Stibbe, Professor of Ecological Linguistics at the
        University of Gloucestershire, discusses how his work in discourse analysis and ecolinguistics offers insights
        into shaping more ethical, sustainable societies. This is particularly relevant to the reason we're brought
        together: plant-based eating. The discussion presents interesting considerations regarding how we conceptualize
        the stories of our plant-eating habits and how we express them to others.</p>

      <p>For a good portion of the episode, Stibbe makes a point of outlining his expansive definition of what a story
        is. He describes stories as <span class="highlight-bright">"reservoirs of meaning"</span>, an important characterization in understanding how Stibbe
        links language to behaviour He lays out his and other ecological linguistics scholars’ mandate to create an
        explicit ecological philosophy or <span class="highlight-bright"> “ecosophy,”</span> a philosophy shaped by their scholarship on wellness and
        well-being. This forms the standard against which a text is then evaluated as either beneficial or detrimental.
      </p>

      <p>To express some of Stibbe’s beliefs on the matter, his research rejects the dichotomy that narratives are either true
        or subjective. Moreover, socially constructed realities, in his view, are at play everywhere and all the time.
        Throughout the episode, he also emphasizes the interconnectivity that exists between humans, other living beings, and
        the environment. His ecosophy is simply:</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Living!</em></strong></p>

      <p>One genre of story that encapsulates this ecosophy is <span class="highlight-bright">indigenous knowledge systems</span>. At the mention of
        indigeneity in this discussion, I thought about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQm1EEW79RI&t=198s">this video</a>  by Andrew Sage, the creator of the <i>Andrewism</i>
        YouTube channel, where he outlines two definitions of indigeneity: indigeneity by means of colonial relationship
        and indigeneity by means of land relationship. These are important definitions. From the conversation, I got the
        impression that Stibbe was using the latter definition.</p>

      <p>However, in the South African context, where the land and the colonial relationship are intricately intertwined
        for Black and other racialized people, our stories, including those that concern our political and fundamentally
        human wills, are required in moving our country in an ecologically beneficial direction. A great example of this
        is discussed in <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4fmfhYblxKg5SkEZCTMVvu?si=d6c63cdbf7ef45d8">this episode</a> of the <i>Knowing Animals</i> podcast, where Dr. Esther Alloun from the University of
        Wollongong presents her research on the animal rights movements in Palestine and Israel, examining how their
        positionality in the settler colonial dynamic gave rise to very different modes of activism.</p>

      <p>Colonialism imposed many stories of subjugation, one of which is the chapter called <i>Capitalism</i>, a
        concept referred to in this discussion as a <span class="highlight-bright" >“macro story”</span>, a big, destructive story at that. In its pervasiveness
        in the shared socially constructed reality, it actualizes behaviours such as centering oneself rather than the
        collective, prioritizing economic growth at all costs, and commodifying and objectifying everything outside of
        ourselves. This story also dehumanizes us, creating a world where we operate and are treated as consumers.</p>

      <p>Our individual decisions to pursue a more plant-based diet are defined by a care ethic, environmental concern,
        religion, or other beliefs, but they largely manifest as choices about consumption, and if it is the sole 
        manifestation, it is little more than virtue signaling through conspicuous consumption. This is why the title of
        this episode is so salient:</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Being more rather than having more.</em></strong></p>

      <p>Stibbe describes one method he uses in implementing his ecosophy as a tool to analyze stories. He examines who
        and what occupy what he calls <span class="highlight-bright">"activated roles"</span> in a text and who or what occupy <span class="highlight-bright">passive roles</span>. Life is movement, doing, action,
        and so positioning someone or something as inactive is life-denying—both in the text and the reality it reflects
        and influences.</p>

      <p>What I particularly like about this measure is that it’s a fairly simple heuristic to apply to our academic
        essays and reports. It can reveal implicit stories nestled within our explicit arguments that we may not
        otherwise notice.</p>

      <p>In reflection, this episode has encouraged me to try and notice the stories I tell in my personal life. They
        aren’t all intricately hidden. They are in the small things, the mundane things, the obvious things, and the
        arbitrary things. It’s about when I tell an event organizer that I can bring my own vegan meal and the story/ies I
        reconstruct in that behaviour. It’s a story of complacency. It’s also a story of visible difference. It’s also a
        story of my relationship, as a woman, with being “inconvenient.” It’s a story of the accessibility of vegan
        products. It’s a story about my commitment to my own ecosophy.</p>

      <p>Noticing the stories that connect all the features of our reality is the first step in creating new ripples,
        adding new wildlife to the macro stories—these vast oceans of meaning. It’s a curiously wonderful way for
        thought to be actionable. And this should be <span class="highlight-bright">our action</span>: identifying our stories, rewriting them, creating new
        stories based on our own ecosophies, and most importantly, sharing them!</p>

      
      <p>I hope you enjoyed my food for thought!</p>

      <p><strong>Something Extra</strong></p>

      <p>I’m currently reading <i>The Overstory</i> by Richard Powers, a great fiction read where nature is positioned
        in an active role. I have a copy in ePub format, so if you’re interested in getting it, please contact me.</p>

      <h2>About the Podcast and Guest</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr Arran Stibbe</strong> <br /><em>Professor of Ecological Linguistics at the University of
          Gloucestershire</em>
        <br />Stibbe’s research examines how language encodes the stories we
        live by, and shapes how we see ourselves and our relationship with
        other animals and the earth. This involves linguistic analysis of a
        wide range of discourses, from advertising which encourages people to
        buy unnecessary and ecologically damaging products, to the
        inspirational language of nature writing. He is the founder of the
        International Ecolinguistics Association.<br /><a href="https://www.glos.ac.uk/staff/profile/arran-stibbe/"

        <strong>Sentientism </strong></br>
        <em>Evidence, reason and compassion for all sentient beings</em><br />Hosted by Jaime Woodhouse, the Sentientism
        podcast discusses the biggest
        questions: "what's real?", "who matters?" and "how to make a better
        world?" with scientists, celebrities, activists, writers and
        philosophers. The Sentientism worldview is a simple, yet radical,
        philosophy that's grounded in reality (naturalistic epistemology) and
        has compassion for all sentient beings (mostly human and non-human
        animals). Naturalism & sentiocentrism combined.</br>
